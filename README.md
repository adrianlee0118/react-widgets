## About

Bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Some useful widgets created in preparation for my impending website migration to Gatsby, saved to the cloud because of my 6 year-old laptop's imminent demise.

To improve mine and possibly others' understanding, widgets were/are built first in pure React with both classes and function components (React hooks in useState and then with useReducer), then in React-Redux.
